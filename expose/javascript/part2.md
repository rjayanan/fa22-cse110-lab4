# Question 1 
The number 3 gets printed as i becomes 0,1,2 during the for loop. After the last iteration, i gets incremented to 3 during the post increment.
# Question 2
The number 150 gets printed as price[2] is 300 and 300 * 0.5 = 150
# Question 3
The number 150 gets printed as 150 * 100 / 100 = 150.
# Question 4
The function will return an array that looks like this [50,100,150] which is the initial prices [100,200,300] multiplied by 1-discount
# Question 5
The code causes an error as i is defined only during the for loop and trying to access it afterwards created a ReferenceError that i is not defined
# Question 6
The code causes an error as discountedPrice is only defined during the for loop and trying to access it afterwards causes a ReferenceError that discountedPrice is not defined
# Question 7
The number 150 gets printed as 150 * 100 / 100 = 150.
# Question 8
The function will return an array that looks like this [50,100,150] which is the initial prices [100,200,300] multiplied by 1-discount
# Question 9
The code causes an error as i is defined only during the for loop and trying to access it afterwards created a ReferenceError that i is not defined
# Question 10
The length of the array is caclulated in line 4 to be 3. Thus, the print statement prints the length to be 3.
# Question 11
The function will return an array that looks like this [50,100,150] which is the initial prices [100,200,300] multiplied by 1-discount
# Question 12
A. student.name
B. student['Grad Year']
C. student.greeting()
D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
E. student.courseLoad[0]


# Question 13
A.'32' String concatenation
B. 1 Arithmetic Subtraction
C. 3 Arithmetic Addition with null being 0
D. 3null String Concatenation
E. 4 Arithmetic Addition with casting of true to 1
F. 0 Arithmetic Addition with casting of false to 0 and null to 0
G. '3undefined' String Concatenation
H. NaN Undefined Behavior in Calculation

# Question 14
A. true, string '2' gets casted to 2
B. false, alphabetically '1' is less than '2'
C. true, after casting, both sides are equal
D. false, string '2' when not casted is not the same as 2
E. false True gets casted to 1 and 1 != 2
F. true Boolean(2) evaluates to true which doesn't need to be casted to be evaluated

# Question 15
== cannot differentiated 0 from false and does casting to convert types to then be compared with the == equality operator. === is a more strict equality check that checks equality without type conversion.

# Question 16
Look at script part2-question16.js

# Question 17
We are returned a new array that is doubled the initial array... we thus have a returned array of [2,4,6]

# Question 18
Look at script part2-question18.js

# Question 19
1Output of code: 1,4,3,2
